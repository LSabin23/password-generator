# password-generator

## Purpose
JavaScript password generator that will provide a randomly generated password that fits user selected criteria including character length, uppercase, lowercase, numeric, and special character inclusion.

The available criteria is arranged within a nested array and as the user makes criteria selections the array is spliced accordingly. This does necessitate that users refresh the page before attempting to generate a new password in order to reset the available array items.
